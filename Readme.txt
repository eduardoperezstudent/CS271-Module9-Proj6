This is a series of test files I used for CS271 Project 6. I tried
to make the filenames short so they're easy to type in when testing.
Files t3.txt through t8.txt are intended for Extra Credit 1.

Here's what they are:

* t0.txt - 24 nums, delimeter = '$' (dollar sign)
* t1.txt - 24 nums, delimeter = ' ' (space)
* t2.txt - 11 nums, delimeter = ',' (because 11 is odd and original 24 was even)
* t3.txt - 6 lines, 24 nums, delimeter = ','
* t4.txt - 5 lines, 24 nums, delimeter = '$' (dollar sign)
* t5.txt - 7 lines, 24 nums, delimeter = ' ' (space)
* t6.txt - 6 lines, 11 nums, delimeter = ',' (11 nums for same reason as t2.txt)
* t7.txt - 6 lines, 1 num  , delimeter = ','
* t8.txt - 6 lines, 2 nums

Good luck!
